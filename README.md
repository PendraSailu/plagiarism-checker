# Plagiarism Checker using Python and NLP
* A nightmare for any writer is the fear that their work might unknowingly fall into the trap of plagiarism. This project aims to tackle that issue by providing a reliable,
cost-free plagiarism detection tool built with Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and a Search API.
# Project Overview
* This Python-based **Plagiarism Checker** scans user-provided text and searches for overlaps across publicly available online content. 
* It uses NLP techniques to analyze the semantic meaning of content and a search API to query the web for similar or identical passages.
# Features
* **Natural Language Processing:** Breaks down and analyzes text at a semantic level using libraries like nltk or spaCy.

* **Search API Integration:** Leverages a web search API (e.g., Bing Search API, Google Custom Search API) to find matches online.
  
* **Plagiarism Score:** Calculates and returns a plagiarism percentage based on matched content.
  
* **Privacy Focused:** All checks are done locally except web queriesâ€”your content isn't stored or sold.
  
* **Modular Codebase:** Clean and extensible for enhancements (e.g., support for PDFs or DOCX files).
# Technologies Used
* Python
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) or spaCy
* Search API (e.g., Bing Web Search, Google CSE)
* Fuzzy Matching or Cosine Similarity for comparison
# Future Improvements
* Support for DOCX, PDF, and TXT files.
* More intelligent sentence-level analysis using Transformers (BERT).
* Web-based UI using Flask or Django.
* Multilingual support.
